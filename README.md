# Treap-
Generalized Treap with Lazy Propagation
A treap is a data structure which combines binary tree and binary heap (hence the name: tree + heap = Treap).
It is a powerful data structure which can do a lot of operations in O(log(n)) amortized.
## Operations include: 
1. All the operations possible using segment tree with lazy propagation.
2. Cutting a any Treap segment in O(log(n)) amortized.
3. Search for any element in O(log(n)) amortized.
4. Intersection of 2 Treaps in O(log(n)) amortized (Not implemented).
5. Reversing any segment in O(log(n)) amortized.
6. Insertion of a Treap segment at any position in O(log(n)) amortized.
